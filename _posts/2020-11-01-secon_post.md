# Cornell Notes System

We will record the main ideas for a quick reference from Jeremy's fastAI book here 

## Divide your page into two columns.

The narrower left column is for recording keywords, questions, and recall prompts. The right column is for your actual notes taken during a lecture or class.

GENERAL INSIGHTS

BEFORE STARTING ANY MODEL

ANYTHING TO IMAGES

CODE TIPS

DOCUMENTATION

### Notes

- Overfitting is the single most challenging aspect in deep learning
- But only apply all the corrective methods of overfitting when you observer overfitting
- ALMOST ALWAYS use a pre-trained model
- LEARN how to fine tune those methods for your use
- Picking an architecture is not all important, there are standard know models that are known to work for specific tasks, try your hand on those.
- You can harness the power of CNN by converting data in other domains to images. Like sound waves, time series curves, mouse movements , gray scale of malware binaries.
- The general idea is , if a human eye can categorize from images, then a deep learning model should be able to do so.

- To get the documentation of any method

```python
doc(learn.predict)
```

## Create a summary section at the bottom.

When you review your notes, briefly summarize what you learned and what is important to retain from the full page of notes. This will help you internalize the information.

**SUMMARY: Basic insights for getting started quickly on deep learning projects** 

## Here's an example:

We promise, a template is coming below! 

### Recall

**What is the definition of propaganda?** 

**What are the 4 techniques used by advertisers?**

**What is an example?**

### Notes

- Propaganda is messages intended to persuade audiences to adopt a certain option.
- Advertisers use propaganda using 4 techniques:
    - Testimonial
    - Bandwagon
    - Plain folks
    - Transfer
- Testimonial example: Michael Jordan sells Nike shoes

**SUMMARY:** Advertisers use propaganda to sell products, and use 4 different techniques to do so.

## Here's your template!

`@today` automatically stamps your notes with today's date. Fill in the topic of the lecture or class. Then use the Cornell Notes structure below. Click the `+ New Notes` button above to automatically generate a fresh set of notes in this format.
